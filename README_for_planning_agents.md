Implementations of planning agents can be accessed in the [agents folder](pddlgym/agents). 
For usage example of a planning agent to solve non-deterministic tasks in domains such as AUV and Perestroika, see [demo](pddlgym/demo_agent_planning.py).

Implementation of "nature" to simulate non-deterministic events can be found [here](pddlgym/nature.py).
